# Voice-Based-Email-for-Blind-and-Visually-Impaired-Using-Python
Voice based email for blind and visually impaired using python.

The project was a Python-based speech-to-text voice response tool developed for visually impaired individuals. 
Its aim was to enable users to operate their mail accounts solely through voice commands, including tasks such as reading, 
sending, and performing other important operations. The system would prompt the user with voice instructions to execute specific actions. 
The primary advantage of this method was the elimination of the need for a mouse, as users were able to interact solely through their voice.
